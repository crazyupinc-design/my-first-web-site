<h2>말씀</h2>
<p>사람들은 주의 두려운 일의 권능을 말할 것이요 나도 주의 위대하심을 선포하리이다</p>
그들이 <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lFHn8YQPO4" target="_blank" title="붓소핸섭-ButsoHandsUp
찬양">주의 크신 <u>은혜</u></a></strong>를 기념하여 말하며 주의 의를 노래하리이다

<br><br>1   The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
<br>2   Day to day pours our speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
<br>3   There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard.
<br>4   Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
In them he has set a tent for the sun,
<br>5   Which comes out like a bridrgroom leaving his chamber,and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.
<br>6   Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
<br>7   The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple;
<br>8   the precepts of the LORD is right, rejoicing the heart; the commanment of the LORD is pure,
enlightening the eyes
<br>9   the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.
<br>10   More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
<br>11   Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
<br>12   Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.
<br>13   Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me!
Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.
<br>14   Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
